Android App developed in Java with Android Studio.

App allows for registration and logging in of users using Google Firebase (Authentication and Firestore).
App then allows researchers to add any users that they wish to survey, and then send any chosen user any survey question of their choice.
The app will then ping the user with the question and once the question has been answered, it will then ping the researcher with the answer chosen.
