1. Initiate a migration folder using init command for alembic to 
perform the migrations.
$python manage.py db init

2. Create a migration script from the detected changes in the 
model using the migrate command. 
This doesnâ€™t affect the database yet.

$python manage.py db migrate --message 'initial database migration'

3. Apply the migration script to the database by using the 
upgrade command

$python manage.py db upgrade

If everything runs successfully, you should have a new postgres database
flask_boilerplate_main.db file generated inside the main package.

4. Each time the database model changes, repeat the migrate 
and upgrade commands

RUN migration.sh to do step 4
